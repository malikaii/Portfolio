          My name is Malick Ouedraogo, I work as a full stack developer at the
          IBM CIC in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. My experience in the industry as a
          full stack developer has equipped me with a strong foundation with
          RESTful apiâ€™s, responsive design, testing and debugging,
          microservices, web security, as well as cloud based development.
          Having been a part of an agile development team, I gained
          collaborative skills and presentation skills especially through sprint
          reviews. I believe in effective communication and cooperation to
          deliver high-quality software solutions within deadlines. I thrive in
          challenging environments and enjoy tackling complex problems. Through
          my previous experiences, I have honed my ability to analyze issues,
          identify efficient solutions, and implement them effectively.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="text-xl ">
          Outside of work, I enjoy collecting and playing music, cooking ethnic meals as well as creative writing. 
          When I have the time, I like to work on side projects that will deepen my knowledge and experience.
